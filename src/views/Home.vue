    <p>
      The Aroueris Hathor Temple of the Golden Dawn, Asheville has been active
      in the Asheville Area since 2012. We are the official Southeast United
      States representatives of the

      home of adepts Chic and Tabatha Cicero.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our members are dedicated to fostering the growth of the esoteric
      community in North Carolina and the greater Southeastern United States
      region by spreading knowledge to sincere seekers of the Golden Dawn system
      of magic.  Whether you are an absolute beginner, an aspiring student or an
      adept in your own field, we hope that you will find something here that
      helps you on your journey towards the Light.

    <p>
      If you feel that the Golden Dawn system of magic is the path you wish to
      pursue, please contact us for membership information. It should be noted,
      however, that despite its prevalence, the Order is rather reserved and
      membership is by invitation only.
